    <h1>Hey Seven?</h1>
    <p>I don't know if you'll ever find this, but a girl can hope!!</p>
    <p>
      I'm so sorry to disappear on you. Maybe when things calm down I can find
      you again. I feel a little silly only relying on site chatboxes to talk,
      and I really wish I could get a message straight to you right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out the plan to go viral worked out a little too well. Thanks to
      you, we cracked 100k total views, and got featured front and center on the
      Neocities home page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lots of new people visited the site, and most of them were nice, but I
      guess when there are that many people, some of them turn out to be not so
      nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know if you noticed before I took the site down but the guestbook
      and chatbox and everything was getting filled with really terrible stuff.
    </p>
    <p>Like REALLY bad. Madoka Magica episode 3 bad.</p>
    <p>
      I got really scared because of how much stuff about me is on my site. I
      don't know how but someone called my home phone. I got emails at my
      personal account. I'm so sorry I didn't say anything to you but I was just
      so scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing I could think of doing was to play dead and hope they
      forget about me
    </p>
    <p>
      The last thing I wanted was for any of this to spill over to you. I mean,
      you know how many links there are from my site back to yours (don't think
      I didn't notice the extra hrefs you snuck in on other people's buttons,
      just sayin)
    </p>
    <p>
      But now my parents are scared and I don't know if they'll let me do any
      kind of webmastering again so I don't know when or how I'll be able to
      talk to you. I'm so sorry. This site was yours as much as it was mine. But
      that's why I didn't want you to see what they did to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you find this. I hope you understand. I hope you stay cheerful and
      passionate and magic. Bye, Cubey.
